# FastFeynmanDiagrammatics: Susceptibility code

*Authors: Riccardo Rossi and Fedor Å imkovic IV*

## What does the code compute?

The codes outputs the spin and charge susceptibility on a certain momentum-frequency grid. See the self-energy readme file at ``../SquareTriangular1PIC/README.md` for more information.
